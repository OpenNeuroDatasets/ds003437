## Description
We scanned participants with the aim of determining the effects of ketogenic diet on brain function. We performed scans under three conditions:  (1) Standard diet: following their standard diet, without fasting; (2) Fasting:  following their standard diet, with an overnight (12 hour) fast; and (3) Ketogenic Diet:  following a ketogenic (high-fat, moderate-protein, low-carbohydrate (<50g/day)) diet for one week, by which point all participants were in ketosis (>0.6 mmol/L ketone blood concentration). Subjects performed various tasks, including resting state (task-rest), motor task (task-uni) and spatial navigation (task-ab), each lasting 10 minutes. Spatial navigation was repeated by all subjects for another 30 minutes. For more details, see our article referenced below.
