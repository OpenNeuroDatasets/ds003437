## Description
We scanned participants under three conditions:  (1) Standard diet: following their standard diet, without fasting; (2) Fasting:  following their standard diet, with an overnight (12 hour) fast; and (3) Ketogenic Diet:  following a ketogenic (high-fat, moderate-protein, low-carbohydrate (<50g/day)) diet for one week, by which point all participants were in ketosis (>0.6 mmol/L ketone blood concentration). Run-1 BOLD images involve 10 minutes resting state (33%), 10 minutes motor task (33%), and 10 mins spatial navigation task, respectively. Run-2 functional files are spatial navigation only.
